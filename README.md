# Self-Driving Car with JavaScript
Created: 2024-MAY-15 | Updated: 2024-JUNE-3

A project I created following a (freeCodeCamp course)[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-virtual-world-with-javascript/]. This is Part 1, and has helped me to not only work out a complex
 JS program, but to work out specific solutions too.

The project can be acessed here: https://self-driving-car-with-javascript.onrender.com.
